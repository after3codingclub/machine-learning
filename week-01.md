<h1>teachable machine class 01</h1>
<p>today we are going to learn how to use the teachable machine model and intergrate it into a project</p>
<h3>teachable machine image model</h3>
<p>this image model will determine one of two outcomes based on what we teach it: https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image</p>
<p>the example we're using is hat/no hat: https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/B9AH5hi-P/</p>
<p>once we upload this model to the cloud, we will intergrate it into a scratch based interface: https://playground.raise.mit.edu/create/</p>
